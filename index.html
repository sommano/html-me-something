            <p>The world of Azeroth is an awesome place to visit. 
			   It is a fantasy world where Orcs and humans can coexist peacefully or in total warfare with each other. 
			   Azeroth contains many demon and monsters to battle for glory and spoils of war.
			   Some enemies are easy while others take an entire army to take down.
			   Some bad guys are big, bad, and mean to the good guys. 
			   It takes skill and power to overcome these enemies. 
			   But once these bosses fall, you can earn reputation, gold, treasure, and glory from this acheivement.

			<p>One of the Planets in this fantasy world is Azeroth. There are 5 continents that one can adventure in the world of Azeroth.
			   There are dungeons and raids that contain enemies inside each of these continents.
			   The Orcish horde dominate the continent of Kalimdor, while the humans occupy the Eastern Kingdom.
			   Pandas come from the land of Pandaria. Pandarans are the master race of Azeroth and are the best race on Azeroth.

			<p>All characters in the World of Warcraft are born and start out as lowly peasants. 
			   We begin life at level 1 and need to work our way up to level 110.
			   This journey is long and hard and many die along the way or simply run out of gametime.
			   It is the survival of the fittest.
			   </p>

			<p>First one character must choose a class from a list of 12.
			   Each class has different abilities and spells.
			   Some are stronger with swords and some are better at magic and spells.
			   There are 3 roles one can play in this adventure. A tank, DPS, or a healer.
			   A tank is the strongest of the group and charges head on to an enemy.
			   They are responsible for getting the attention of enemies and protecting them from the other party members.
			   A dps is someone who deals damage to enemies and stands in fire.
			   A healer is a medical specialist whom may help out other party members with bandages if needed.
			   One can adventure out in the world as a solo player. but it is easier to play as a group of 5 people in a dungeon.
			   Some bigger bosses in a raid may require a group of strong people of 10-40 group members.

			<p>Boss Fight #10: Aggramar</p>

			   He was once the noble Avenger of the Pantheon, but was struck down by Sargeras and reborn as a titan of 
			   destruction.

			<p>Boss Fight #11: Argus</p>
			<p>The biggest bad boss of the raid is Argus. Bound. Broken. Eons of existence, knowing only pain. 
			   A shattered soul, fueling infinite evil. The master beckons. Rise... Rise! Begin, the end of all things.

            <h2>Quest Completed</h2>
            <p>When the final boss Argus of Antorus is defeated the quest is finally completed.
			   A long hard journey as been made with many friends and adventurers.
			   The defeat of the boss allows all of us Adventurers a chance to earn a bird from the Council of Six.
			   It is called the Violet Spellwing Raven. It is a reward from the quest to defeat Argus from our Quest givers Council.
			   However treasures and gold isn't the main reason the raid was fun. 
			   It is the journey and fun of the group accomplishment that is why we continue to go on adventures.
